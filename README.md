The goal of this project is make a variety of easily accessible files for Splatoon, Pokemon, and other Nintendo-themed content creation. 
Within, you'll find resources that you can use in a variety of projects - art, 3D modeling, SFM, VRChat/NeosVR/etc.
Whatever your creative ambitions, TentaLabs aims to give you the tools to succeed!
